wrapper classes
----------------
wrapper classes in java(eg Integer, Double, Boolean .. etc) are used to wrap primitive data types(int, double, Boolean etc) into Objects.
They are part of java.lang packages and server the following purposes.

common wrapper classes
--------------------------
Byte for byte
Short for short
Integer for int
Long for long
Float for float
Double for double
Boolean for Boolean
Character for char

Autoboxing and AutoUnboxing
-------------------------------
Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class.
Auto unboxing is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class Object to its corresponding primitive type.

what are the differences btw arrays and collections

Arrays                                                                                                     Collections
Arrays are fixed in size                                                             Collection are growable in nature

memory point of view Arrays are not recommended to use                               memory point of view Collections are recommended to 										     use .
    
performance point of view arrays are recommended to use                              performance point of view Collections are not recommended to use.

Arrays can hold both primitive and object types 			 	     Collections can hold only object types but not primitive type.

arrays can hold only homogeneous data type elements. 				     Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous data type elements 

for arrays there is no underlying data structures for arrays                         every collections class is implemented based on some standard data structure and hence readymade support 
and hence there is no readymade method support 					     is available.


Collections
-----------
if we want to represent a group of objects as a single entity then we should go for collection


9 key interfaces in collection framework
=========================================
1. collection
2. List
3. set
4. sorted set
5. NavigatableSet
6. Queue
7. Map
8. SortedMap
9. NavigatableMap

----------------------------------------
what is the difference between Collection and Collections
--------------------------------------------------------------
Collection is an interface which can be used to represent a group of objects as a single entity

where as collections is an utility class which is Present in java.util package to define several methods for collection Objects

Collection(Interface)
----------------------
if we want to represent a group of individual objects into a single entity then we should go for collection interface. this interface defines the most common general methods which can be applicable for any collection object.

it is the root interface for entire collection framework.

the following is the list of methods present in collection interface
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. boolean add(Object o);
2. boolean addAll(Collection c);
3. boolean remove(Object o);
4. boolean removeAll(Object o);
5. Boolean retainAll(Collection c);
6. Void clear();
7. Boolean contains(Object o);
8. Boolean containsAll(Object o);
9. Boolean isEmpty();
10. Int size();
11. Object[] toArray();
12. Iterator iterator();
